The objective of blackjack is to accumulate cards with point totals as close to 21 
without going over 21. Face cards (Jacks,Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points. Aces are 
worth 1 or 11, whichever is preferable. Other cards are represented by their number.

1. To win the player needs to beat the dealer without busting.

2. The player busts when the player’s cards total to more than 21 and the player looses automatically.

3. Before receiving any cards players must place a wager.

4. Each player in turn either stays or takes more cards to try and get closer to 21 without busting.

5. Players who do not bust wait for the dealer's turn. 

6. When all the players are done, the dealer turns up the down card.

7. By rule, on counts of 17 or higher the dealer must stay; on counts of 16 or lower the dealer must draw.

8. If the player makes a total of 21 with the first two cards (a 10 or a face and an Ace), the player 
   wins automatically. 
   This is called 'Blackjack'.
	
9. If the player has Blackjack, the player will win one and one-half times the player’s bet unless the 
   dealer also has Blackjack, in which case it is a Push or a Tie (or a Stand-off) and the player 
   gets his bet back.
	
10. The remaining players with a higher count than the dealer win an amount equal to their bet. 

11. Players with a lower count than the dealer lose their bet. If the dealer busts, all the remaining players win.
